# Doxyfile 1.8.8

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project.
#
# All text after a double hash (##) is considered a comment and is placed in
# front of the TAG it is preceding.
#
# All text after a single hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored.
# The format is:
# TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists, items can also be appended using:
# TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (\" \").

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Project related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

# For config item PROJECT_NAME, default is My Project
PROJECT_NAME           = "OSVR-Core"

# For config item OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, default is
OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = doxygen

# The STRIP_FROM_INC_PATH tag can be used to strip a user-defined part of the
# path mentioned in the documentation of a class, which tells the reader which
# header file to include in order to use a class. If left blank only the name of
# the header file containing the class definition is used. Otherwise one should
# specify the list of include paths that are normally passed to the compiler
# using the -I flag.

# For config item STRIP_FROM_INC_PATH, default is
STRIP_FROM_INC_PATH    = inc

STRIP_FROM_PATH        = inc

# If you use STL classes (i.e. std::string, std::vector, etc.) but do not want
# to include (a tag file for) the STL sources as input, then you should set this
# tag to YES in order to let doxygen match functions declarations and
# definitions whose arguments contain STL classes (e.g. func(std::string);
# versus func(std::string) {}). This also make the inheritance and collaboration
# diagrams that involve STL classes more complete and accurate.
# The default value is: NO.

# For config item BUILTIN_STL_SUPPORT, default is 0
BUILTIN_STL_SUPPORT    = YES

# If the EXTRACT_LOCAL_CLASSES tag is set to YES classes (and structs) defined
# locally in source files will be included in the documentation. If set to NO
# only classes defined in header files are included. Does not have any effect
# for Java sources.
# The default value is: YES.

# For config item EXTRACT_LOCAL_CLASSES, default is 1
EXTRACT_LOCAL_CLASSES  = NO
# Default value for CASE_SENSE_NAMES omitted

# If the SHOW_GROUPED_MEMB_INC tag is set to YES then Doxygen will add for each
# grouped member an include statement to the documentation, telling the reader
# which file to include in order to use the member.
# The default value is: NO.

# For config item SHOW_GROUPED_MEMB_INC, default is 0
SHOW_GROUPED_MEMB_INC  = YES

# If the SORT_MEMBER_DOCS tag is set to YES then doxygen will sort the
# (detailed) documentation of file and class members alphabetically by member
# name. If set to NO the members will appear in declaration order.
# The default value is: YES.

# For config item SORT_MEMBER_DOCS, default is 1
SORT_MEMBER_DOCS       = NO

# The INPUT tag is used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like myfile.cpp or
# directories like /usr/src/myproject. Separate the files or directories with
# spaces.
# Note: If this tag is empty the current directory is searched.

# For config item INPUT, default is
INPUT                  = README.md \
                         HACKING.md \
                         inc \
                         doc \
                         examples

# The RECURSIVE tag can be used to specify whether or not subdirectories should
# be searched for input files as well.
# The default value is: NO.

# For config item RECURSIVE, default is 0
RECURSIVE              = YES

IMAGE_PATH = doc
MSCFILE_DIRS = doc

# If the USE_MDFILE_AS_MAINPAGE tag refers to the name of a markdown file that
# is part of the input, its contents will be placed on the main page
# (index.html). This can be useful if you have a project on for instance GitHub
# and want to reuse the introduction page also for the doxygen output.

# For config item USE_MDFILE_AS_MAINPAGE, default is
USE_MDFILE_AS_MAINPAGE = README.md

# If the GENERATE_LATEX tag is set to YES doxygen will generate LaTeX output.
# The default value is: YES.

# For config item GENERATE_LATEX, default is 1
GENERATE_LATEX         = NO

# If the MACRO_EXPANSION tag is set to YES doxygen will expand all macro names
# in the source code. If set to NO only conditional compilation will be
# performed. Macro expansion can be done in a controlled way by setting
# EXPAND_ONLY_PREDEF to YES.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag ENABLE_PREPROCESSING is set to YES.

# For config item MACRO_EXPANSION, default is 0
MACRO_EXPANSION        = YES

# If the EXPAND_ONLY_PREDEF and MACRO_EXPANSION tags are both set to YES then
# the macro expansion is limited to the macros specified with the PREDEFINED and
# EXPAND_AS_DEFINED tags.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag ENABLE_PREPROCESSING is set to YES.

# For config item EXPAND_ONLY_PREDEF, default is 0
EXPAND_ONLY_PREDEF     = YES

# The PREDEFINED tag can be used to specify one or more macro names that are
# defined before the preprocessor is started (similar to the -D option of e.g.
# gcc). The argument of the tag is a list of macros of the form: name or
# name=definition (no spaces). If the definition and the "=" are omitted, "=1"
# is assumed. To prevent a macro definition from being undefined via #undef or
# recursively expanded use the := operator instead of the = operator.
# This tag requires that the tag ENABLE_PREPROCESSING is set to YES.

# For config item PREDEFINED, default is
